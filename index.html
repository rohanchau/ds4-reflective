<h4>UNIT 15: QUESTIONS</h4>



<p>Unit questions—What is the field of design? Where are my interests in it and why? How do my interests reflect my design values and why?  </p>

<p>Upon reflecting on the field of design, I found I was most drawn to its ability to take advantage of visual forms to provoke curiosity. The task of doing so within “design” has its limitations though, due to the fact that work is often produced for someone else, to meet a specific need. That being said, I find that</p>

<h4>UNIT 16: WORKING TOGETHER</h4>



<p>Unit Question—How can collaboration catalyze design action?</p>

<p>I worked with Stephanie and Joshua to develop a creative practice, which we named &#39;Custom(s)&#39;</p>

<h4>UNIT 17: PACKAGING</h4>



<p>Unit question—How can graphic design communicate a whole that is greater than a sum of parts?</p>

<p>When we began narrowing down our interests at the beginning of the assignment, I was keen to shape an interest to be educational to whoever was receiving my package. I chose to explore &quot;imagined urbanism,&quot; referring to the contemplation of future landscapes. The idea of a package, rather than a physical package, interested me, which led me to employ a &quot;speculative time capsule&quot; as my method of delivery.  The package was used as a tool to distort time by decontextualizing the user, instructing them to reposition themselves as a civilian in 2038. Repositioning themselves in the future, would hopefully shape how they think in the present. In reconsidering the package for this unit, I wish I took the performative &quot;unboxing&quot; aspect into greater consideration. The package I designed felt more appropriate for someone to unbox alone, in a quieter space, with more time to reflect upon the various questions presented. </p>

<h4>UNIT 17—Packaging, Locating Territories</h4>

<p>Locating Territories was the preliminary research exercise of the unit, in which we explored topics within our various interests.</p>

<h4>UNIT 17—Unboxing Stephanie&#39;s Package</h4>

<p>A video made reflecting on my unboxing of Stephanie&#39;s package. I ultimately felt like I was given a personal library, which encouraged me to explore the various sources presented. I particularly enjoyed the simultaneity of the experience!</p>

<h4>UNIT 18: CONSTRAINTS</h4>

<p>Unit question—What constraints shape your work?</p>

<p>Based on the extensive list of questions provided, I chose to respond to &#39;Is it loud enough?&#39; Treating this as my base constraint, I then unpacked the question to situate it within a certain discourse. I found I was drawn to visual loudness, and loudness in relation to digital formats, leading me to constrain myself to not use sound, and explore &#39;clickbait,&#39; as the phenomenon related to how loudness aims to capture attention. Much of my research revolved around how this occurs on the web, within content marketing and journalism. I&#39;m interested in virtual reality (particularly as I was also taking the class &#39;Intro to Computation&#39;), and was curious as to how &quot;visual loudness&quot; transcends traditional digital surfaces (like mobile/desktop screens), and lives in immersive environments. Moreover, as my research led me to examples observing and critiquing loudness/clickbait in areas where we&#39;d expect such things to occur (e.g. overt advertising, entertainment, news), I constrained myself to explore the phenomenon in an arena atypical to these instances. This ultimately led me to create &#39;Calm Time,&#39; a speculative VR relaxation experience that critiques an attention economy capitalizing off passivity. I feel as though the piece also manages to critique the medium of VR itself, by purposefully adopting high-fidelity glossy aesthetics to remind users of the allure and &quot;wow-factor&quot; of VR that draws people in, and cloaks any underlying incentives.</p>

<h4>ANTI-ANTI-ALIASING</h4>

<p>ANTI-ANTI-ALIASING  </p>

<p>This was a 2-day workshop led by Mindy Seu and Jon Gacnik that focused on the term anti-anti-aliasing, defined as “a moment of revealing and finding the seams that indicate what lies below a surface.”   </p>

<p>The first day of the workshop involved a production of an Exquisite Corpse, in which we collaboratively created a “communal quilt” by editing an assigned tile of a map. The second day involved created a diptych relating to a specific theme.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the results yielded from this workshop, and found that I quite enjoy making quick work. This was a good break from several research-intensive projects—it encouraged quick fabrication, to meet a brief in a short timeframe. I think applying this workflow and way of thinking to the beginning of longer projects could be useful for developing several strong ideas. </p>
